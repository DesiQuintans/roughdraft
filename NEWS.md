- MOD - Ctrl+Insert (not Ctrl+Pause) toggles RoughDraft-Mode on and off.
- MOD - Change program icons in the tray.


# 2019-12-09

- ADD - Ctrl+Pause toggles RoughtDraft-Mode on and off.
- MOD - Instead of completely disallowing "edits" (backspace, control-backspace, or 
  ctrl+z), allow one per second. This lets you undo typos but heavily discourages 
  serious editing. Only the end of the current line/sentence can be edited.
- FIX - The `+` key is correctly sent, rather than being interpreted as a Shift key.



# 2019-12-06

- FIX - Shifted keys and punctuation marks are sent correctly.
- MOD - Reduced the wait time before {End} was sent again.
- MOD - Allow undo/redo so that simple typos can be immediately corrected.



# 2019-12-05

- Initial release.
