# RoughDraft-Mode

_No deleting or replacing; you can only write new things._

This is an Autohotkey script that disables your ability to delete, overwrite, undo, or
redo text, similar to [emacs' draft-mode](https://github.com/emacsmirror/draft-mode),
but it can be used in any program.

When you lose the ability to delete or replace text, you are unable to edit
yourself in the moment. All you can do is keep charging forward and writing new
things.



## Usage

Download the newest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/DesiQuintans/roughdraft/releases). You can put the files anywhere you like.

Run `RoughDraft-Mode.exe`. If you would prefer to run an uncompiled script, then you can install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) and run `RoughDraft-Mode.ahk`.

  experience of writing in RoughDraft-Mode is like yelling out thoughts as they
  pop into my brain.
